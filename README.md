## Whole steps

1. I took a boiler template from my previous internship project.
2. I've used JWT for auth & express-validators for validations.
3. I've used ORM(sequelizer) to manage MySQL.
4. I've followed a clean structure for routing and controllers.
5. To be frank, Yes i took help of chatgpt and i was low on time(I completed this project in 2 hrs).
6. I used your Library: @theinternetfolks/snowflake. It was a good reference.
7. Some Api's may not be authenticated as shown in docs sent by you.
8. I've always worked on AWS for deployment for company's project. As i didn't have a credit card therefore i was not able to host it.
9. I've used try and catch blocks and asynchronous functions everywhere.




## Installation
